============

The Tasks assigned were:
1) To make a Facebook app by which user collect all his friends and sort them by the max friends they have.
2) To tell the user the like shared maximum across all his friends (which I interpretted as to find the url that was 
being liked maximum by the immediate friends of the user in his social graph. Liked maximum here means whose sum of 
likes,shares,comments was maximum.)

Both them are completed and can be checked at the below :

The app can be checked @ https://apps.facebook.com/wikasta_one/ (Will be visible to the developers only).

How to use:
When the user click on the app, it will redirect it to a page hosted at my techblog's domain, where the required
information will be visible in plain text format. 

The top array will display the information regardin the first task and the second array will display information 
regarding the second.
