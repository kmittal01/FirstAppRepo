FirstAppRepo
============
First part of the task was to retrieve the number of friends each of the user's friend have in his friend list and 
sorting them by 'number of friends'. This was easily done using fql and the permissions required was just the basic info 
of the user.

A major part of the task assigned is still left. One of the reason for the same being that facebook requires 
'read_stream permission' to be enabled, before giving the likes of the users. However, changing the permissions of the 
app seems to be taking too much time. So it is getting difficult to check and get desired results. 

The app can be checked @ https://apps.facebook.com/wikasta_one/ (Will be visible to the developers only).
