FirstAppRepo
============
First part of the app was to get the nuber of friend of each friend in the user's friend list and sorting them by the 
number of friends. This was easily done and the permissions required were on the basic info of the user.

A major part of the task assigned is still left. One of the reason for the same being that facebook requires 
'read_stream permission' to be enabled, before giving the like of the users. However, changing the permissions of the 
app seems to be taking too much time. So it is getting difficult to check and get desired results. 

The app can be checked @ https://apps.facebook.com/wikasta_one/ (Will be visible to the developers only).
